# OpenInfra journey
The journey and the documents I will take as I go through the passage to become a open infra contributor...  
After a failed trying to contribute to Django project, I have gone deeply into cloud operations and automation tasks and by my past experience as a talented developer and the admiration I have to openstack I have came up with the idea to focus and became a contributor to the sub projects...  
So here we are...

# Accounts
1. Supposedly there is a mailing list or something which I dont have and donts understand what it is...  
2. Git flow Gerrit: There is a highly alien flow of git exclusively for openstack, You need an account to be a part of the process... hosted on [https://review.opendev.org/](https://review.opendev.org/), This is the account you will send your PRs and review process will be done, so add your SSH key in the settings.  
3. Launchpad: You need a [https://launchpad.net/](https://launchpad.net/) account, I think this is used as a issue tracker, And I believe this is the legacy tool and they are moving to something new.
4. Storyboard: This is the new thing for issue tracking [https://storyboard.openstack.org/](https://storyboard.openstack.org/).
5. IRC: Ok this is also very unusual and weird, I just put this link here [http://hexchat.github.io/downloads.html](http://hexchat.github.io/downloads.html).
6. OpenInfra Account: Join to [https://openinfra.dev/](https://openinfra.dev/), And create an indivisual account.

Ok I think these are enough to start next go to next step...
